# StartPages

Browser startpage collection. Well, not really a collection, but more will be added someday :D

![alt Wow](https://github.com/peux-os/startpages/blob/master/snapshots/wow.gif)

The two currently available startpages are:
* Wow ( because I was stunned myself :D )
* starting-wave ( not good at naming things )

## wow

The man behind the design is Catalin: https://dribbble.com/hisk
The kick-ass implementation was done by Nathan Taylor: https://dribbble.com/nathantokyo
The starting page implementation is done by me on top of Nathan's work.

#### How to change the Links?
Wow => index.html => Line 66 is the beginning

#### How to change the background picture?
Wow => css/style.css => Line numbers = 75, 80, 93, 244, 276, 288, 311 ( Don't hate me for not keeping the pictures path in there, means when you will test it, it will be plain black and white, but the pictures are available in the snapshots-directory and now you know where to change them )


## starting-wave

This is the simplest one. Doesn't require much work unless you are willing to improvise it.
The procedure is same, the default search-engine kept is "Google". You'll have to manually adjust the search-engine to your preferred choice.

BONUS: [Get Waves](https://getwaves.io/) is the tool that'll give you waves ;) . Implement it the way you like.

### Prerequisites

This section is kept to keep you engaged in this readme ( It's a trap - common have a little laugh ).

### How to use?

**FIREFOX**

PREFERENCES => HOME => HOMEPAGE AND NEW WINDOWS (set the path to the startpage .html file)

**GOOGLE**

SETTINGS => APPEARANCE => ENABLE "SHOW HOME BUTTON" => NEW TAB PAGE (set the path to the startpage .html file)

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

**OTHER BROWSERS**
I don't use any other, so you might have to check on your own, should be similar.

## Final Words

Free to use, change, implement ( ain't that obvious too ). If possible, do fork. If you are too lazy, then just clone and enjoy ;)
If you are redistributing it in any form, do give credit to Nathan and Catalin for their hardwork.
